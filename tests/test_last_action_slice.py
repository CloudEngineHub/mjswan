"""`last_action(action_name=...)` slice resolution (ADR 0005 §Decision).

Layer: L1 (pure Python — a stub action manager, no mjlab env build).

mjlab's `last_action(action_name=...)` is `get_term(name).raw_action`: that one
term's slice of the policy output, not the whole vector
(`mjlab/envs/mdp/observations.py`). The graph is fed the vector whole, as the runtime
holds it, and slices it at the offset `ActionManager.process_action` gives the term by
accumulating `action_term_dim` in config order. `action_term_window` mirrors that walk.

Every reference task declares a single action term, where the slice and the whole
vector coincide — which is why the runtime reading the vector's head went unnoticed.
These cases are therefore the coverage for the two-term shape; no buildable task
exercises it yet.
