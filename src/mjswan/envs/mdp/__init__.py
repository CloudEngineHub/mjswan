"""MDP components for mjswan.

``actions`` mirrors ``mjlab.envs.mdp.actions``: mjlab's own action classes run natively
in the browser, so ``mjswan.envs.mdp.actions`` carries real, directly-usable action-term
configs, same import pattern as mjlab::

    from mjswan.envs.mdp.actions import JointPositionActionCfg

A task's own action class is traced instead (ADR 0009); ``mjswan.register_action`` names
what its ``apply_actions`` does when it overrides it.

``observations`` / ``terminations`` / ``events`` are different: mjswan reimplements
none of mjlab's term functions. Pass mjlab's own straight to
``ObservationTermCfg(func=obs_fns.base_lin_vel)`` and the build traces them. These
submodules carry only the ``*Binding`` escape hatch and its ``register_*`` registry.

``commands`` is the exception: it carries the operator-driven command presets, binds
mjlab's command classes by cfg name, and rewrites the reset jitter of the one it keeps
native (``MotionCommand``).
